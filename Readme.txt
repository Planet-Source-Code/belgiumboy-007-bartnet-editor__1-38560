THis is my first texteditor so there probably are some restrictions in the flexibility of the program.

IMPORTAND : Do not delete or rename any *.BartNet files as they are required for BartNet Editor to run properly.

There is one problem that i am unable to fix for the time being.  You cannot save twice as an error wil occur.
